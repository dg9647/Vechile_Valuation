## Automated Valuation for Used Two-Wheeler & Used Car.

This is the github repository created for the End to End Machine Learning project done by: Divyansh Gupta, Tanmay Shukla. 


This project has the goal to predict the valuation of used two-wheeler and used cars.<br>
This project uses a Machine Learning model in the backend to predict the valuation of used two-wheeler and used cars.<br>
We worked with the Kaggle dataset about used cars and their prices. <br>
The models was evaluated on the basis of R<sup>2</sup>score <br>
